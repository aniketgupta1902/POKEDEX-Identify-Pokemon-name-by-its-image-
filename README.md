# POKEDEX-Identify-Pokemon-name-by-its-image-

This project is decided to challenge to Python newbies with was the development from scratch of a Pok√©mon search engine that internally uses the KNN Machine Learning algorithm, also implemented from scratch. Broadly, our search engine would work with the following steps:

1) first by asking the user an input.
2) taking those inputs and looking for which pokemon most closely resembles that input.
3) finally showing the user the search results.

It is a ML based project which can identify the name of Pokemons by its images in dataset and images folder.Support Vector Machine is used to train the model and keras is used to process images.
